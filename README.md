FAQ -
Is there a way to save the game?
	No. 

Why are there only trees sometimes?
	The trees are randomly generated. Sometimes they will be very rare. But if they spawn in the starting area they will be in the same spot.

Why are some parts of the world invisible?
	It's a glitch I wasn't able to fix. Be grateful you can play a game in class.
	(It is an issue with threading. Multiple CPU cores are getting assigned more and more threads. This causes some chunks to get skipped. I did it wrong. But I'm going to blame it on Unity.)

How do I exit the game?
	If you read this ReadMe File you know. Good Job. (Thereâ€™s no reason for this question to be here because they didn't read this file.)

Is this game safe?
	Play at your own risk. I will not be held liable. (It should be fine)

Can I dig through the bottom of the world?
	Try it.
